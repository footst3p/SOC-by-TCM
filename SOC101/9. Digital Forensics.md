### Introduction to Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is the process of identifying, collecting, analysing, and preserving digital evidence from electronic devices.
### The Digital Forensics Investigation Process
Stage:
1. Identification: Confirm that an incident or crime has taken place.
2. Preservation: Ensuring evidence remains intact and unaltered.
3. Collection: Gather all of the identified evidence.
4. Examination: Inspect, analyse, and interpret evidence.
5. Analysis: Interpret the evidence.
6. Presentation: Communicate the results.
7. Decision: Evaluate the results and make a decision.<br>

### Data Acquisition
- Evidence: Data that supports an investigative hypothesis. These are digital forensics artefacts.

- Evidence Sources:
  - Desktops and laptops
  - Smartphones and tablets
  - Hardware devices and external storage
  - Network devices
 
### Order of Volatility
1. CPU Registers and Caches
   - Processor registers
   - Caches memory
   - Running processes
2. RAM and Active Network Connections
   - Random Access Memory
   - Network connection
   - Routing table
   - ARP cache
3. Temp Files and System Logs
   - Temporary files
   - Swap files
   - System and application logs
4. Disk Storage Data
   - Hard disk drives
   - Solid state drives
   - System configurations
5. Remote Logging
   - Endpoint telemetry
   - Centralised log collection
6. Archive Media
   - Long-term storage media
   - Backups
   - Security controls
### Forensic Data Integrity
- Write Blockers: Preserving the integrity of storage and devices.
- Evidence Bags: Contain and protect evidence.
- Legal Holds: Litigation hold
- Documentation: Collection procedure, tools, condition, observation
### Chain of Custody
- Track evidence throughout the entire investigation
- Documents evidence of possession
- Storage conditions<br>
