### Introduction to Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence is the process of collecting, analysing, and applying information about potential or current attacks that
threaten an organisation.
Cyber Threat Intelligence is a specific subset of threat intelligence. CTI focuses on information related to threats in the digital
or cyber domain.
### Types of Threat Intelligence
1. Strategic Threat Intelligence
   - High-level analysis - trends, risks, impacts
   - Threat actor motives, goals, and capabilities
   - Deciding long-term security strategy
2. Tactical Threat Intelligence
   - Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
   - Threat actor behaviours and methodologies
3. Operational Threat Intelligence
   - Imminent threats, plans, and timelines
   - Tracking threat actors and groups
4. Technical Threat Intelligence
   - Tools, infrastructure, and technical capabilities
   - Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
   - Integrate into tooling to enhance detection methods.

### The Threat Intelligence Cycle
1. Requirement and Direction (Planning)
2. Collection (Processing)
3. Analysis (Examinating)
4. Dissemination (Distributing)
5. Feedback (Reviewing)

### Threat Intelligence Sources
1. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
   - Dark web, forums, and social media
   - Passive reconnaissance, vulnerability, and malware database
   - Public repositories
2. Commercial Threat Intelligence
   - Provided by third-party vendors
   - Proprietary subscription-based threat feeds
   - IoCs, Malware signatures, attack patterns
3. Vendor Reports and Security Research
   - Published reports and whitepapers
4. Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISACS)
   - Industry groups facilitating threat intelligence sharing<br>

### The Diamond Model
The Diamond Model is a framework used in cybersecurity to understand and analyse cyberattacks.
It says every cyber attack has four main parts, like the four corners of a diamond:
1. Adversary: Represents the individual or group that is responsible for the intrusion.
2. Capability: Things that are developed and used by adversaries during an attack.
3. Infrastructure: All resources and systems leveraged by the adversary to facilitate their attack.
4. Victim: The target of the adversary.<br>

### The Cyber Kill Chain
A conceptual framework that is used to break down the different stages of an attack.
1. Reconnaissance: Information gathering
2. Weaponisation: Creating malware or malicious payloads designed to exploit any identified vulnerability.
3. Delivery: Transferring the payload to the target
4. Exploitation: The payload is executed on the target system
5. Installation: Installing additional malware on the target to maintain persistent access
6. Command and Control (C2): Established a communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure.
7. Actionson Objectives: The actual goal of the attaker.<br>

### The Pyramid of Pain
The Pyramid of Pain shows how difficult it is for attackers when defenders block different types of indicators.<br>

The higher you go on the pyramid:<br>
- the more painful it becomes for the attacker,
- because they must spend more time, money, resources, or creativity to continue the attack.
1. Hash Value (Trivial)
2. IP Addresses (Easy)
3. Domain Names (Simple)
4. Network / Host Artifacts (Annoying)
5. Tools (Challenging)
6. TTPs (Tough)<br>

### Introduction to YARA
YARA = Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym <br>
YARA is a tool used in cybersecurity to identify malware by looking for patterns inside files.

Think of it like creating “rules” that help you recognise malware. It is just like antivirus signatures, but more flexible 
and customizable.<br>
